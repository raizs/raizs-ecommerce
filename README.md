## What's this?

This is a sample app to demonstrate how you can achieve both **Server Side Rendering** _and_ **Code Splitting** in a create-react-app.
It supports the mini-series I've wrote on _Medium_ about this topic:

1. [Upgrading a create-react-app project to a SSR + Code Splitting setup](http://medium.com/bucharestjs/upgrading-a-create-react-app-project-to-a-ssr-code-splitting-setup-9da57df2040a)
2. [Adding state management with Redux in a CRA + SSR project](https://medium.com/bucharestjs/adding-state-management-with-redux-in-a-cra-srr-project-9798d74dbb3b)


## How can I see it in action?

Just install dependencies, build the app and run the express server:

```
yarn install
yarn run build
yarn run server
```
